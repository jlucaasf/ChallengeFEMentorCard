# ChallengeFEMentorCard
Challenge from Frontend Mentor for create a small card landpage


Here are the first steps to becoming a programmer, starting with the basics of HTML and CSS.
I took on the challenge suggested by the FronendMentor website, to create a sales card for a perfume. 
I used the basics of HTML complemented with style in the CSS. I also made a small responsive adaptation for screens smaller than 750px and 375px.
